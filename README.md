5. CloudFront  domain is attached to the bucket
<br />
CloudFront distribution domain name:	
<br />
```sh
dzz5chuashrb9.cloudfront.net
```

  </a>
<br />
<br />

6. Now the static website is available from web browser via website-endpoint : 
```sh
http://my-048086412071-next-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

Try it. You have to see that static website via browser.
